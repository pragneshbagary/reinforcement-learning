# Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction - Implementation Examples

This repository contains Python implementations of reinforcement learning algorithms and examples from Sutton & Barto's "Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction (2nd ed.)".

## Overview

Each directory contains implementations of examples and algorithms from the textbook. The code covers fundamental reinforcement learning concepts including value functions, policy learning, and temporal difference methods applied to various environments and problems.

## Examples

| Example | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| tic-tac-toe | Temporal difference (TD) learning agent that learns to play tic-tac-toe through self-play |

## Structure

Each example directory contains:
- Problem/environment implementation
- Agent implementation with learning algorithm
- Training script
- Evaluation/testing script

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- No external dependencies (each example is self-contained)

## Usage

Navigate to any example directory and follow its specific instructions:

```bash
cd tic-tac-toe
python train.py
```
